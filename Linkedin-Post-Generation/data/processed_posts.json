We can keep optimizing systems designed for a different industrial era or we can redesign value chains to be intelligent, equitable, and regenerative by design. The next generation of advantage will not come from faster lanes or lower unit costs alone. It will come from how we architect intelligence, resilience, and trust into the system itself. \n\nFive shifts for leaders include:\n\u2022 Using AI as planetary intelligence rather than a cost-cutting tool\n\u2022 Designing supply chains that grow stronger under stress\n\u2022 Making circularity and regeneration core operating models\n\u2022 Treating transparency as shared trust infrastructure\n\u2022 Expanding resilience to include communities and geopolitical stability.",
